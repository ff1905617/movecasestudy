                MOVE! is an exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. 
                The exhibit aims to showcase art about commuting experiences 
                from around the world and to emphasize how we all may have more 
                in common than we think.

            <p>
                I started this project after visiting the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. 
                I was inspired by a collection of Japanese wood block prints that 
                depicted different modes of transportation. It made me think about how 
                my day, in a sense, revolves around transportation. I spend about an hour 
                every day getting to and from school and work. My commute often sets 
                the tone for my day. Since the experience of commuting is a universal one,
                I thought it would be interesting to curate an art exhibit that focuses on
                different commuting experiences from around the world.
            </p>

                I created a series of sketches to solidify my concept and establish a visual identity. I was 
                inspired by the Western Maryland Railroad branding. This eventually evolved into the visual identity
                I would end up creating during week two. I also sketched out some other exhibit concepts to avoid 
                marrying myself to one idea so early on.

            <p>
                I brought my sketches into Adobe illustrator and started experimenting. I was inspired by Boston's own MBTA but wanted
                to keep the momentum conveyed by the typeface used for the Western Maryland railroad branding. I found PP Talisman, a beautiful 
                typeface by Pangram Pangram. The bold italic weight was exactly what I wanted. The color pallette I used was a play on the MBTA's
                own color scheme. I thought this was appropriate considering the exhibit would take place in Boston.
            </p>
                <br>
            <p>
                <b>Wayfinding</b>
                <br>
                The wayfinding component of the project was the most simple. I planned on taking the logo and putting it on arrow shaped signs, simulating a vinyl wall installation.


            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
            <b>Augmented Reality</b>
                <br>
                My idea for the Augmented reality experience would also tie into the wayfinding. Upon entering the museum and downloading the MOVE! app,
                the user would be prompted to choose a "line." Each line is a different path with obstacles that eventually leads you to the MOVE! exhibit.
                The user would use their mobile device's camera to follow an AR path around the museum. The lines are supposed to simulate the commutes 
                of different people based on where they live as well as expose visitors to exhibits they may have never seen before along the way.

            <br>

            <p>
            <b>Desktop Web</b>
                <br>
                The Desktop Website is an informational page about the exhibit and provides a download link for the MOVE! app.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
            <b>Social Media</b>
                <br>
                The social media campaign uses photos taken by users on their journeys to the exhibit that they can share using the MOVE! app.

                        <p>
                            This week, I started refining my ideas. I focused mainly on the Augmented Reality experience accessed through the 
                            MOVE! app. I created interactive Figma screens to simulate a user journey through the app. I also incorporated the 
                            social media experience into the figma screens. 
                        </p>

                </div>

                <p>During the fourth week, I went to the Museum of Fine Arts multiple times and got lots of video footage. 
                    Not all of it was viable but I skimmed through and put a video together. I created some transitions in After Effects. 
                    I realized during this week that After Effects is not as scary as it looks.

                <p>
                    I continued to animate in After Effects during the final week of the project. I used Eleven Labs AI to create a voice over for my video and 
                    used <i>Subways - The Avalanches</i> for the background music. Special Thanks to Rory O'Donnell and Jodie Bermant.
